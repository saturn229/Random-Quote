creates a print function that:
1. sets a variable to the getRanomQuote function
2. creates an empty string to store a string to be added to html in the future depending on the quote being used
3. uses conditional statements to see if the quotes have citations or years in their object
4. selects the div in the html by its id and changes the innerHTML to the one set by the conditional statements

//created an if statement for if button is clicked printQuote runs but if it isnt clicked within 10 seconds setInterval will run printQuote
